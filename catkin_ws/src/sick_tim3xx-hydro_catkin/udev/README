To give all users write access to the Sick TiM 300 device, run the following
commands:

    sudo cp 81-sick-tim3xx.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

Now unplug your USB cable and plug it in again.  This will allow you to
communicate with the laser scanner without running the node as root and fix the
following error:

    LIBUSB - Cannot open device; please read sick_tim3xx/udev/README
