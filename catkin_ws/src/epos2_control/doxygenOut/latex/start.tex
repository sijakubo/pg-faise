In the next steps you will get Introduction how to bring an existing roboter-\/setup to life.\hypertarget{start_start_step1}{}\section{Step1\-: Power on the Robot}\label{start_start_step1}
First you may \hyperlink{troubleshooting_checkWires}{Check the Wires}. To power on the robot afterwards, you had to press the green button (see \hyperlink{index_hw_setup}{The Hardware Setup}). The switches 1 (E\-P\-O\-S2) and 2 (Laserscanner) right of the power button should be switched on.\hypertarget{start_start_step2}{}\section{Step2\-: Waiting until the robot is ready}\label{start_start_step2}
Some L\-E\-Ds are switch on others are off. If the robot get not into this state within 5 minutes lock at \hyperlink{troubleshooting_checkLEDs}{The Meaning of the L\-E\-Ds}.\hypertarget{start_start_step3}{}\section{Step3\-: Drive the robot}\label{start_start_step3}
There are different driving-\/\-Modes by using the gamepad. When the robot doesn't move, you can switch between this modes by pressing the \char`\"{}\-R\-B\char`\"{}-\/\-Button of the Logitech F710. For other gamepads it's the .... button.\hypertarget{start_mode_tank}{}\subsection{driving-\/mode\-: One Stick for each side}\label{start_mode_tank}
With the left stick you set the velocity for the left side of the robot and with the right stick for the right side of the robot.\hypertarget{start_mode_twostick}{}\subsection{driving-\/mode\-: Velocity and Turning with two sticks}\label{start_mode_twostick}
The right Stick (only up and down) set the forward velocity and the left stick (only left and right) set the angular velocity of the robot.\hypertarget{start_mode_onestick}{}\subsection{driving-\/mode\-: Velocity and Turning with one stick}\label{start_mode_onestick}
Same as \hyperlink{start_mode_twostick}{driving-\/mode\-: Velocity and Turning with two sticks} but both directions (up -\/ down \& left -\/ right) are set with one stick.\hypertarget{start_power_off}{}\section{Last Step\-: Power off the robot}\label{start_power_off}
After driving you can power off the robot by press and hold the red power button until the Lights of the Power-\/panel are switched off.
